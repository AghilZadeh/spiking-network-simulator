# spiking-network-simulator
This repository includes a spiking neural network simulator with different levels of biological details. With this simulator, you can build leaky integrate and fire (LIF) neural networks with realistic synaptic transmissions and desired neural structures and inputs.

Generally, one can use any sort of connectivity matrix in this simulator. Additionally, there are built-in functions that can construct multi-population networks by defining high level connectivity strengths and probabilities between populations and it creates random block connectivity matrices with given statistics.

Moreover, any time-dependent input can be defined to feed into the network. Built-in functions can construct random Poission inputs with given statistics.
